Notebook Developed during the Open City Climate Hackathon in Bengaluru, India in August 2025 conducted with the following objective:

"To collate data from a range of sources (including ones which are typically not collected by city agencies frequently, but are essential for measuring key outcome indicators) for a few selected climate action KPIs for the city (derived from Bengaluru Climate Action Plan - BCAP)• To analyse data to measure the outcomes of the selected KPIs to track the progress of climate actions implemented in the city• To visualize the measured outcomes in a user-friendly interface, which could be plugged into existing CAC-MER dashboards (if any)"

The specific KPI chosen by our team was: Area of tree canopy cover – Annual change in the city’s tree canopy cover (‘Tree canopy cover’ refers to the layer of leaves, branches, and stems of trees that, when viewed from above, covers the ground)
